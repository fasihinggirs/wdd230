                This webpage is too simple to use; its material is brief, and on the home page, you can quickly locate what you're looking for. This page works well because repetition is used well. If you look at the red boxes, you'll see that they include just information regarding vaccines, while the blue boxes provide information about other topics. The grid, the typeface, and the color scheme all repeat. Because there are two persons in every picture, we may even observe repetition in the pictures.

                This website does a great job of using white space, which elevates the page's appearance by effectively utilizing padding. White space need not be dull. I adore that the word "SALE" in the black and yellow color scheme on this page even somewhat contrasts with it. This contrast makes the white space look appealing, well-organized, and extremely modern, which is I believe the goal. Zara's page employs white space to balance out the colors and accents that are prominent in other areas of the page on this page.

                On this websitee, we can see how the colors contrast. The black color dominates the page, and it contrasts beautifully with the light blue symbols and buttons as well as the white type. The contrast on this website is also evident in the text sizes and style, and the color scheme of the pizza adds to the effect.
