  <p>Osaka is a major financial center of Japan, and it is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in Japan. The city is home to the Osaka Exchange as well as the headquarters of multinational electronics corporations such as Panasonic and Sharp. Osaka is an international center of research and development and is represented by several major universities, notably Osaka University, Osaka Metropolitan University, and Kansai University. Famous landmarks in the city include Osaka Castle, Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan, D≈çtonbori, Ts≈´tenkaku in Shinsekai, Tenn≈çji Park, Abeno Harukas, Sumiyoshi Taisha Grand Shrine, and Shitenn≈ç-ji, one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Japan.</p>

  <p>The city's west side is open to Osaka Bay, and is otherwise completely surrounded by more than ten satellite cities, all of them in Osaka Prefecture, with one exception: the city of Amagasaki, belonging to Hy≈çgo Prefecture, in the northwest. The city occupies a larger area (about 13%) than any other city or village within Osaka Prefecture. When the city was established in 1889, it occupied roughly the area known today as the Chuo and Nishi wards, only 15.27 square kilometres (6 sq mi) that would eventually grow into today's 222.30 square kilometres (86 sq mi) via incremental expansions, the largest of which being a single 126.01-square-kilometre (49 sq mi) expansion in 1925.</p>

  <p>Central Osaka is roughly divided into downtown and uptown areas known as Kita (Âåó, "north") and Minami (Âçó, "south").[49][50]

      Kita is home to the Umeda district and its immediate surrounding neighborhoods, a major business and retail hub that plays host to Osaka Station City and a large subterranean network of shopping arcades.[49] Kita and nearby Nakanoshima contain a prominent portion of the city's skyscrapers and are often featured in photographs of Osaka's skyline.
      
      Minami, though meaning "south", is essentially in Ch≈´≈ç Ward (‰∏≠Â§ÆÂå∫, Ch≈´≈ç-ku) and geographically central within the city.[50] Well known districts here include Namba and Shinsaibashi shopping areas, the D≈çtonbori canal entertainment area, Nipponbashi Den Den Town, as well as arts and fashion culture-oriented areas such as Amerikamura and Horie. The 300-meter tall Abeno Harukas is the tallest skyscraper in the country since 2014</p>

  <p>On 18 June 2018, around 7:58 a.m. Japan Standard Time, an earthquake measuring 5.6 Mw on the moment magnitude scale (preliminary 5.5 Mw) struck in northern Osaka Prefecture, Japan. The earthquake's epicenter was near Takatsuki and occurred at a depth of approximately 13 kilometres (8.1 mi). The Japan Meteorological Agency reported a magnitude of 6.1 Mj and an intensity of 6 lower on the shindo scale.[1]

      Shaking from the earthquake was felt strongly in the prefecture and the nearby metropolitan areas of Osaka and Kyoto, temporarily disrupting electrical and gas service to 170,000 homes and buildings. The earthquake struck during rush hour, disrupting train services for several hours, and also damaged water pipes and hundreds of homes.[2] Four people were killed, 15 serious injuries were reported, and 419 people had minor injuries</p>
